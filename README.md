# Day Predictor AI 😆

A fun little web app built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that pretends to “predict” the future with a dramatic animated loading screen — and then reveals the ultimate truth:

> **2026 mein to duniya khatam hai 😂**

This project includes:
- Animated loading overlay
- RGB progress bar effect
- Rotating spinner
- Fake “AI-style” status messages
- Final reveal meme animation as the background
- Clean and responsive UI

It’s just for fun — nothing serious here.  
But it's a nice way to learn **DOM manipulation, animations, and UI design.**
